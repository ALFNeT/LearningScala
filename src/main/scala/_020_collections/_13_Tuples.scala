/**
  * > A tuple combines a fixed number of items together so that they can be passed around as a whole.
  * > Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types.
  *
  * > Tuples save you the tedium of defining simplistic data-heavy classes.
  * > Even though defining a class is already easy, it does require a certain minimum effort, which sometimes serves no
  * purpose.
  * >> Tuples save you the effort of choosing a name for the class, choosing a scope to define the class in, and
  * >> choosing names for the members of the class. If your class simply holds an integer and a string,
  * >> there is no clarity added by defining a class named AnIntegerAndAString.
  *
  * > Because tuples can combine objects of different types,tuples do not inherit from Traversable.
  * >> If you find yourself wanting to group exactly one integer and exactly one string, then you want a tuple, not a
  * List or Array.
  *
  * > A common application of tuples is returning multiple values from a method.
  *
  * â–¶ As a note of warning, tuples are almost too easy to use.
  * >> Tuples are great when you combine data that has no meaning beyond "an A and aB."
  * >> However, whenever the combination has some meaning, or you want to add some methods to the combination, it is
  * better to go ahead and create a class.
  * >>> For example, do not use a 3-tuple for the combination of a month, a day, and a year.
  * Make a Date class.
  * >>> It makes your intentions explicit, which both clears up the code for human readers and gives the compiler and
  * language opportunities to help you catch mistakes.
