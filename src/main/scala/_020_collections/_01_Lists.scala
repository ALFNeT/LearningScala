/**
  * > Lists are quite similar to arrays, but there are two important differences.
  * >> First, lists are immutable. That is, elements of a list cannot be changed by assignment.
  * >> Second, lists have a recursive structure (i.e., a linked list), whereas arrays are flat.
  *
  * > Perhaps the most important sequence type to know about is class List,the immutable linked-list.
  * >> Lists support fast addition and removal of items to the beginning of the list, but they do not provide fast
  * access to arbitrary indexes because the implementation must iterate through the list linearly.
  *
  * > The list type in Scala is covariant. This means that for each pair of types S and T, if S is a subtype of T, then
  * List[S] is a subtype of List[T]. For instance, List[String] is a subtype of List[Object]
  * >> This is natural because every list of strings can also be seen as a list of objects.
  * >> The empty list has type List[Nothing].
  * >> So the empty list object, which has type List[Nothing], can also be seen as an object of every other list type of
  * the form List[T] (Nothing is the bottom type of every other type in Scala).
  *
  *
