/**
  * Puzzler 8 - Map Comprehension
  * What is the result of executing the following code?
  *
  * zs fails because there are no default case and no case for List of 2 members.
  *
  * In Scala, the i <- 0 to 1 syntax is called a generator. With generators that perform a simple variable assignment,
  * it's easy to forget that the generator's left-hand side is not a simple variable, it's a pattern, as demonstrated
  * by Seq(x, y, z) <- xs in the code sample. The Scala compiler desugars generators with non-trivial patterns
  * (i.e., patterns that constistute more than a simple variable assignment) differently.
  * This expression:
  * for (pattern <- expr) yield fun
  * ends up being rewritten as:
  * expr map { case pattern => fun }
  *
  * for ys:
  * for (i <- 0 to 1) yield i + 1
  * is desugared to:
  * expr withFilter {
  * case pattern => true
  * case _ => false
  * } map { case pattern > fun }
  *
  * It is this withFilter invocation that transparently "strips out" the non-matching value that causes the
  * MatchError in our attempted desugaring.
  *
  * --> Because for comprehensions are very common in Scala code, familiarizing yourself with how for expressions are
  * desugared is time well spent.
  *
  * --> Unlike filter, which creates a new collection and so incurs the overhead of an entire run through the source
  * collection, withFilter is simply a "view." It lazily restricts the items passed on to subsequent map, flatMap,
  * foreach, and withFilter calls and is specifically designed for efficient chaining of these operations.
