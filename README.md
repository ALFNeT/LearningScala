# My Scala Learning Journey
I do learning-by-doing in this repo, and I make some violations on purpose like the weird package names just to make sure what is the sequence of the contents, so please do not judge me on this :)

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use:
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/). By École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, and teached by Martin Odersky.
* [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2/). By École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, and teached by Martin Odersky.
* [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1/). By École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
* Beginning Scala Programming. By Daniel Hinojosa. Online course on [Safari Online Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/home/).
* Best Practices in Scala Programming. By Joshua Backfield. Online course on [Safari Online Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/home/).
* Scala Core Programming: Methods, Classes, and Traits. By Daniel Hinojosa. Online workshop on [Safari Online Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/home/).
